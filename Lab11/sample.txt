
Prior to the 1680's, Santa wore anything that was warm.  Some years his
clothes were made up of reindeer hair and were brown; some years he wore
cotton and wool, and his clothes were white.

But early in the 1680's, Santa realized he needed a trademark, so people
would know it was him coming down their chimney, and not some robber.
Since that time, he's worn the same clothes every year -- though he usually
reserves the red overcoat and the red hat for his Christmas rounds.

As might be imagined, Mrs. Santa has a real laundering chore when Santa
gets back from his Christmas rounds.  Each chimney he goes down makes him
progressively dirtier, though his outer clothes are specially designed to
absorb soot so he doesn't track it all over everybody's houses.  But by the
time he's done his clothes are filled in every thread and seam and fiber.

Mrs. Claus cleans the clothes using a very simple, though effective, method:
she lays them outside and lets the snow build up on them. By the spring
thaw (such as there is at the North Pole), the clothes are fresh and clean
again, ready to wear!
